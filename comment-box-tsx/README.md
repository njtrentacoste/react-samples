# React CommentBox example rewritten in TypeScript (tsx)

This is an example of how to rewrite React JSX apps in TypeScript (TSX).

It is a work in progress.  I'm still figuring out how to work with forms in React and TypeScript.

To get this app up and running locally:

`npm install`
`bower install`

To compile changes made in the tsx file, from a command prompt, run:

`tsc`

This includes an http-server to test with.  You can start it with:

`npm run start`
